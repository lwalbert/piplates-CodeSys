# piplates-CodeSys 
Connect your Pi-Plates to CodeSYS runtime on Raspberry PI

I Started this project back in 2019 developing libraries for Pi-Plates in CodeSYS.
The library and hardware description files enables SPI communication for Pi-Plates in CodeSYS.
Several Pi-Plates can be stacked and addressed in CodeSYS, tested with 5 Pi-Plates.

Supports the following Pi-Plates:
  * PiPlate DAQC 
            (https://pi-plates.com/daqcr1/)
    - Reads digital input (8 channels)
    - Reads analogue input (8 channels)
    - Writes to digital output (7 channels)
    - Writes to analogue output (2 channels)
            
  * PiPlate DAQC2
            (https://pi-plates.com/daqc2r1/)
    - Not completed yet as my board broke down, So still some work to be done here!!
    
  * PiPlate RELAY
            (https://pi-plates.com/relayr1/)
    - Writes digital output (7 channels)
    - Reads the digital outputs status (7 channels)
  
  * PiPlate MOTOR
            (https://pi-plates.com/motorr1/)
    - Dont remember how far i got with this one :)

Interface cable between Raspberry PI an the Pi-Plates need a small modification to control communication. 
RPI GPIO25 Out are required by Pi-Plates to initiate read from SPI bus. 
Unfortunately GPIOÂ´s cannot be controlled outside a task in CodeSYS eg. within the library, 
so an optocoupler needs to be installed on the interface cable between CS1 (chip select) and GPIO25 wire towards the Pi-Plates.
GPIO25 from Raspberry PI should be cuted and isolated (no connection to Pi-Plates)
  * 1 Optocoupler
  * 1 Resistor
  * 1 GPIO Ribbon Kabel (40 pins F/F) 20cm
